After a number of years I gave up enhancing and supporting Karma Firewall on Google Play because:

 • Poor reviews from people with no idea what a firewall is
 • User demands for customisations
 • Almost no donations
 • Android OS killing my app
 • Google updating SDK API too often
 • Google Play compliance burdens

It is now available on F-Droid
